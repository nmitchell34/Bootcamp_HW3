# Password Generator

## Description 
This is a password generator that will generate a password between 8 and 128 characters (depending on what you desire). You are also able to select what type of characters you want
i.e. lowercase, uppercase, numbers or symbols. The password generated is entirely random, however there is a failsafe in place to make sure that at least one of every character selected is in the final password. If one character type is missing (simply due to probability) then it will be put into the password at a random location.
